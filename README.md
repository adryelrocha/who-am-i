# Who am I?
Este repositório contém dados sobre o meu estudo de HTML, CSS e Javascript.
<br>
My name is Adryel and I'm a student of programming languages. I'm fiveteen years old. I'm Brazilian but at moment I'm living in Portugal, in the state of Porto. In my high school, I'm taking a professional course in management and programming of computer systems, but I always want to learn more, which is why I decided to start, on my own, my studies in HTML, CSS and JS. For the future, I intend to pursue a career in the world of technology and I hope, perhaps, to work for large companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, SpaceX, Microsoft, Apple, etc.
